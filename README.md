# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With rich experience in full-stack development, I have held various positions as managing partner, and employee. I specialize in clean, modern, visually appealing frontend and backend development, but my core focuses are also usability and functionality. All my works are in step with modern technology. Also, I am working as a Blockchain developer as well. My fields of expertise:


Frontend development - Angular 5+, React(Redux, Hook), Vue, HTML/CSS, Web3

Backend development - Flask, Django, Python, Node, Swagger, Typeorm, Ruby on Rails, Solidity

Fullstack development - MERN, MEAN, Vue+Laravel, Django + React, Next, Nuxt

I worked with numerous clients from all around the world from early startups to well-established companies. I always seek new opportunities for cooperation on projects around interesting dashboards or landing pages.
